npm -> abbrevation is not node packkage manger
but it manages packages
npx -> executing the package "npx {Package_name}"

package.json is the configurations for npm 
packages are also called as dependencies
project is dependt on other packages and those package depend on other packages.

package-lock.json -> 
keeps a tract of extract version. for eg in package.json i have ^2.8.3 in one package, if there is a updgrade version available. in package lock it clearly mentions as 2.8.4
integratity in package-lock.json- >hash key to confirm production and local has same version




Bundler:
our code has to be bundled/minified/compressed/cleaned before sending to production.
bundler bundles/packages the app to ship to production.
e.g., webpack,parcel,wheat

npm install -D {Package_name} or  npm i {Package_name}
-D is DEV
whithout -D is notrmal which is used on production

devDependencies in package.json has all dev dependencies

2.8.2 - no updates will be considered
^2.8.2 - caret  - minor upgrades - it will automatically to 2.8.4 . it will not do major update
~2.8.2 - tiled - it will automatically install major upgrade - e.g 3.0.3

node_modules fodler - contains all fodler of packages

transistive dependcies -> package depend on other project and other project depend on other project
every package has its own package.json own dependencies
