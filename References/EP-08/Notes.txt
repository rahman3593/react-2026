Class COmponenet has render method that returns JSX
this.state = {}
setState

First constructor is called > Render

constructor() -> Render() - > componentDidMount()


componentDidMount > to make api call mostly

what is  super(props);
In React (or any ES6 class that extends another class), super(props) is used inside the constructor of a child class to call the parent class’s constructor with the props argument.
Breaking it down:
- super: Refers to the parent class. In React, when you write class MyComponent extends React.Component, the parent class is React.Component.
- props: These are the properties passed into your component, like <MyComponent title="Hello" />.
Why you need it:
- Initialize the parent class
React’s Component class needs to be initialized with props so it can set up things like this.props internally.
- Enable this.props in your constructor
Without super(props), you cannot access this.props inside the constructor. Example:
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props); // initializes React.Component with props
    console.log(this.props.title); // works
  }
  render() {
    return <h1>{this.props.title}</h1>;
  }
}


- If you wrote just super() without passing props, then inside the constructor this.props would be undefined.

Render Phase and commit Phase

constructor and Render is called in Render Phase 
componentDidMount called in commit phase

for functional Component in useEffect() has return  called usereffect return to simillar to componentWillUnmount
